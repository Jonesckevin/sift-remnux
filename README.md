# sift-remnux  ![Docker Cloud Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/digitalsleuth/sift-remnux)
SIFT and REMnux Docker based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Added a docker-compose.yaml to the repo containing the commands required to get the most of the docker.

Once started, run the following: `ssh -X forensics@<ip>` where <ip> is the IP of the docker you identify in the docker-compose.yaml file. 
  
This will provide GUI functionality from within the docker.
